issue: 3n+1 total calls (n = no of repos), which explodes bill + increases 
       time
  fix: doing api calls in batches instead of for every repo, removed 
       redundant api calling for already fetched some data like first scoring every repo relevance according to JD then again creating description by another api call will be redundant so we reduced it to one call

issue: for efficient repo analysis we need to download whole repos, which can be 
       time consuming and not storage efficient
  fix: portia provides out of the box analysis in this case throughh it's cloud features, so then we dont need to download and parse repos manually

issue: portia doesn't provide support for Gemini CLI
  fix: removed portia

issue: downloading repo and performing analysis on each can be time consuming and increases API cost and working directly with Github API increases overhead
  fix: using PyGithub for seamless working with github and fetching files which are truly relevant not downloading the whole repo
